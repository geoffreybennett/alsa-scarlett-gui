# ALSA Scarlett Gen 2/3 Control Panel Installation

## Prerequisites

Linux Kernel with the ALSA Scarlett Gen 2/3 mixer driver. Use at least
version 5.14 for Scarlett Gen 3 support and bug fixes for the Gen 2
support. For Clarett+ 8Pre support, you need 6.1.

For the other Clarett USB and Clarett+ models, see
https://github.com/geoffreybennett/scarlett-gen2/commits/clarett-4pre
for kernel patches.

As of Linux 6.5, the driver is still disabled by default and needs to
be enabled at module load time with the `device_setup=1` option to
insmod/modprobe. Create a file /etc/modprobe.d/scarlett.conf
containing the appropriate line for your device:

Scarlett Gen 2:

- 6i6: `options snd_usb_audio vid=0x1235 pid=0x8203 device_setup=1`
- 18i8: `options snd_usb_audio vid=0x1235 pid=0x8204 device_setup=1`
- 18i20: `options snd_usb_audio vid=0x1235 pid=0x8201 device_setup=1`

Scarlett Gen 3:

- Solo: `options snd_usb_audio vid=0x1235 pid=0x8211 device_setup=1`
- 2i2: `options snd_usb_audio vid=0x1235 pid=0x8210 device_setup=1`
- 4i4: `options snd_usb_audio vid=0x1235 pid=0x8212 device_setup=1`
- 8i6: `options snd_usb_audio vid=0x1235 pid=0x8213 device_setup=1`
- 18i8: `options snd_usb_audio vid=0x1235 pid=0x8214 device_setup=1`
- 18i20: `options snd_usb_audio vid=0x1235 pid=0x8215 device_setup=1`

Clarett+:

- 8Pre: `options snd_usb_audio vid=0x1235 pid=0x820c device_setup=1`

Or you can use a sledgehammer:
```
options snd_usb_audio device_setup=1,1,1,1
```
to pass that option to the first 4 USB audio devices.

To see if the driver is present and enabled: `dmesg | grep -i -A 5 -B
5 focusrite` should display information like:

```
New USB device found, idVendor=1235, idProduct=8215, bcdDevice= 6.0b
Product: Scarlett 18i20 USB
Focusrite Scarlett Gen 2/3 Mixer Driver enabled pid=0x8215
```

If the driver is disabled youâ€™ll see a message like:

```
Focusrite Scarlett Gen 2/3 Mixer Driver disabled; use options
snd_usb_audio vid=0x1235 pid=0x8215 device_setup=1 to enable and
report any issues to g@b4.vu",
```

## Building and Running

On Fedora, the packages `alsa-lib-devel` and `gtk4-devel` need to be
installed:

```
sudo dnf -y install alsa-lib-devel gtk4-devel
```

On Ubuntu 22.04:

```
sudo apt -y install git make gcc libgtk-4-dev libasound2-dev
```

To download from github:

```
git clone https://github.com/geoffreybennett/alsa-scarlett-gui
cd alsa-scarlett-gui
```

To build:

```
cd src
make -j4
```

To run:

```
./alsa-scarlett-gui
```

You can install it into `/usr/local` (binary, desktop file, and icon)
with:

```
sudo make install
```

And uninstall with:

```
sudo make uninstall
```
